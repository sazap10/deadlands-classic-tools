# Hindrances

## Accursed 5

A black curse follows an accursed hero wherever he goes. Fate never seems to give the poor sap an even break. A character with this Hindrance didn’t graduate from the school of hard knocks—he keeps getting held back! The hero draws 2 Fate Chips at the start of a session instead of 3, so he’d better spend them wisely. He can still gain them normally as rewards for good role playing or clever ideas.

## Ailin’ 1/3/5

There are some things doctors just can’t cure. If you get a rash in your crotch from time to time, it’s damned inconvenient. If you’ve got consumption, you’d better make arrangements with the local undertaker. Diseased characters are affected by their ailments depending on the severity and the circumstances of their particular affliction. Lesser ailments are things like chronic allergies or colds, frequent lice, or worms. Some more serious diseases are consumption (tuberculosis), diabetes, and cancer. Remember this is the Weird West, so there are likely far worse ailments out there.

Value Ailment

1 Minor: Your character has a minor but incurable ailment. This might cause him to cough at poor times, make social engagements difficult, give him the shakes, etc. Subtract –2 from any persuasion rolls and sneak attempts.

3 Chronic: Your hero has a chronic illness that causes constant agony and may eventually kill her. She suffers the penalties for a minor ailment, and at the start of each game session, she must make a Fair (5) Vigor roll. If she fails, she suffers –4 to all tasks she performs this session. The Marshal might modify your die roll depending on the weather and your particular illness

5 Fatal: You’ve got a chronic illness that might kill your character at any time. Roll as above. If you go bust, your character must also make an Onerous (7) Vigor roll. Should she fail, Death’s door swings wide.

## All Thumbs 2

You don’t like machines, and they don’t seem to like you much either. Scientific and mechanical Aptitudes cost twice the normal points to learn or improve. All rolls made to use or repair machinery are made at –2.

## Aura o Death 1-5 (Harrowed)

Some Harrowed characters wear their undeath like a shroud. People around them instinctively know there’s something disturbing about these folks, though they can’t quite put their finger on exactly what it is. Still, just as animals tend to slink away from the Harrowed, people avoid those with an undead aura. This doesn’t keep them from whispering about the “creepy strangers” behind their backs, however. This uneasiness means that whenever such a Harrowed makes a roll for Mien or any Aptitude falling under that Trait, she suffers a penalty equal to her level of undead aura. The one exception is the overawe Aptitude, which actually receives a bonus equal to that level, instead of a penalty. Besides these modifiers, the Marshal should roleplay the Harrowed’s general effect on people. It’s much harder for him to form relationships, get information, and ask for help.

## Angst 1-5 (Harrowed)

It’s time to get a little heavy. Think about coming back from the dead from your character’s point of view. It can be a depressing experience. Sure, you’ve cheated death, But now you have a whole new set of troubles. First, there are your friends and family. Maybe they know your coffin is empty, and they’re looking for grave robbers. That’s sure to cause them grief, which can make you feel guilty. On the other hand, do you dare contact those loved ones? Having attended your funeral, they’re liable to react poorly if you show up on their doorstep holding in your slimy innards. Perhaps they’ll think you’re a cruel impostor. Or maybe you’ll just scare the Hell out of them. Then there’s the problem of how to deal with this whole undead thing. Once, you thought you’d live till you died, and then things would be over. You’d spend the rest of eternity playing harp on a cloud somewhere. But now you’re back on Earth with no idea of what the new “rules” are. How long do you have this time? Will you stay this way forever? What about your soul? Learning that your body is energized by an evil spirit can’t make you feel too confident about reaching Heaven any more. For that matter, the whole issue of the manitou inside you is a thorny one. You have to stay in control, or who knows what evil it might do with your sorry carcass. It’s sort of like being joined by leg irons to an ax murderer. As a Harrowed, you’re trapped with no hope for parole and no end in sight. Ever. It isn’t any wonder, then, that many Harrowed live under a permanent shadow of anxiety and depression. For many of them, angst is a constant companion. It greets them every morning with a sardonic smile and taunts them in their restless sleep every night, day in and day out. (The dead do sleep, by the way, as you’ll see later on.) A character with the angst Hindrance has a difficult time rising out of apathy, depression, and guilt to get started on any major course of action. This means that whenever a new game session begins, he suffers a penalty to all his dice rolls equal to the level of the Hindrance. For instance, if he’s got 3 points of angst, he takes –3 to every roll. Once the action is well underway, however, the character finds it easier to stay motivated. One way to escape depression and uncertainty is to just get up and do something. In game terms, each time the character spends a Fate Chip, besides getting its normal effect, he also loses some of the angst penalty for the remainder of the current session. A white chip negates 1 point of angst, a red chip negates 2, and a blue chip negates 3. These chips must be spent during play—they can’t just be tossed away at the beginning of the night. Of course, once the action is over (between your regular gaming sessions), the Harrowed has time to mull things over and sink into that same old “slough of despair” again. At least until he buys off his angst in the next session.

## Bad Ears 3/5

The quick and the deaf choose the level of bad hearing your character suffers from the chart below.

Value Status

3 Mild: Subtract –2 from all Cognition tests based on hearing.

5 Stone Deaf: Your character can’t hear at all.

## Bad Eyes 3/5

Sometimes it’s better not to see what’s coming after you. Bad eyes subtract from any Trait or Aptitude rolls you make for your hero to affect or see things at greater than 20 yards. The Marshal might sometimes allow you to use your bad eyes as a bonus to guts checks when viewing gruesome horrors at this range. If your hero wears spectacles, reduce the value of the Hindrance by 1.

Value Status

3 Myopic: Subtract –2 from your character’s Trait and skill rolls made to see or affect things at greater than 20 yards.

5 Near Blind: As above, but the penalty is –4

## Bad Karma 5

Your hombre has made a lot of enemies in the Hunting Grounds, where the manitous live. And they remember you. Manitous revile your hero so much that your huckster always takes backlash for drawing a Joker, regardless of its color or his skill

## Bad Luck 5

Calamity Jane’s got nothing on you. If you go bust, whatever your character is doing has the absolute worst effect possible.

## Big Britches 3

It’s good to be confident, but only a fool charges 600 cavalrymen into 5,000 Sioux. Your character is severely overconfident. He believes he can do anything, and he never turns down a challenge.

## Big Mouth 3

A little lip-flapping can cause a whole passel of trouble. Your hombre’s lips are looser than Miss Kitty’s drawstring. He always speaks before he thinks. Worse, he’s constantly blurting out the posse’s plans or telling the bad guys what they want to know. The hero also manages to put his boot in his mouth fairly often. No one ever trusts this habitual gossip twice.

## Big ’Un 1/2

Your horse really hates to see you coming. Fortunately, it’s pretty hard to bust up someone your size. The effects of a character’s bulk depend on whether he is merely husky or truly obese. Increasing your character’s Size affects the damage he can take. See Chapter Four for details.

Value Status

1 Husky: Add +1 to your hero’s Size and reduce his movement by one step (minimum is 4). His maximum Nimbleness is a d10

2 Obese: Add +2 to your hero’s Size and reduce her movement by two steps (minimum is 4). Her maximum Nimbleness is a d8

## Blackfoot 1

Up north, it’s important to know where your neighbors stand – and to let them know where you do. Otherwise you could wind up taking customers you shouldn’t, and that can lead to trouble. Blackfoot is not and Indian term, but an Irish one. The Blackfoot were willing to trade and do business with the Protestant English as well as with other Catholic Irish. That’s not a problem, unless you encounter a Whiteboy (see below), but the factions hate each other violently, and have been known to use arson and even murder against one another.

## Bloodthirsty 2

Some folks are just plain mean. Others don’t believe in leaving their enemies alive to come back and haunt them later. Your character rarely takes prisoners, and she enjoys confrontations. If she’s forced to take prisoners, they don’t tend to live long when they’re no longer useful.

## Cautious 3

A good plan can turn a posse into an army. But no army ever won a war sitting on its kiester. Your character is a planner. He likes to plot things out long before any action is taken, often to the chagrin of his impulsive, gun-fighting companions. Of course, sometimes this can be a lifesaver. Custer could have used a little of this Edge.

## Clueless 3

Some folks can’t find a needle in a haystack when they’re sitting on it. The needle, that is. Your cowpoke is about as alert as a light post. Whenever the Marshal asks for Cognition checks to notice things, you must subtract –2 from your roll. Yes, this includes surprise checks.

## Cold Blooded 2

Your mama musta been from sunnier climes, ‘cause you sure can’t handle the cold! It cuts right through you, and sends you shivering to the nearest fire. Old hands like to have fun at your like to have fun at your hero’s expense by hiding his coat. Your character can’t handle the cold. Take a -1 to all nimbleness and quickness – related actions if the temperature is below freezing.

## Crisis o’ Faith 1/3

From time to time, everyone suffers from it— even the blessed aren’t free from doubt. Sure, they can perform miracles, but all the evil in the world may make still make them question their beliefs. Maybe the horrors the hero has seen have made her doubt the intentions of her deity, or maybe she’s just lost faith in her own worth. Whatever the cause, this doubt plagues her whenever her beliefs are put to the test. The character has a –2 to any faith rolls she makes. This includes rolls to invoke miracles. This is a 3-point Hindrance for characters with the Edge arcane background: blessed. For heroes possessing only the faith Aptitude, this is merely a 1-point Hindrance. This Hindrance is only available to characters with at least 1 level in faith. Should the character ever lose her faith, she must immediately buy off this Hindrance or replace it with another.

## Curious 3

If it killed the cat, think what it can do to you. Your hero wants to know all he can about just about everything he comes across. Anytime the character is confronted with a mystery, he must do everything in his power to try to solve it, no matter how dangerous the situation might be.

## Damned 3/5

For whatever reason, Heaven frowns upon your hero. It may be some horrible deed you’ve done in your past, or your character may not even be aware of the source of this divine enmity. Regardless, any helpful blessing from above is denied your character. At 3 points, no beneficial miracles work on your character. Of course, the other, less desirable ones work just fine against him! The hero can’t use miracles or gifts of any sort, no matter how good his intentions. If the hero takes 5 points in this Hindrance, he’s really stepped on somebody’s toes—in fact, he’s still standing on them! In addition to miracles, beneficial shamanic favors also don’t work on him. And as if life wasn’t bad enough, all harmful effects still affect him normally. No blessed character can take this Hindrance, although any other character can. Even if a damned character takes the faith Aptitude, he’s denied any type of holy miracle or gift unless he finds some way to rid himself of this Hindrance.

## Death Wish 5

Sometimes a fellow just doesn’t want to go on. Maybe his family has fallen victim to some heinous creature. Maybe he’s got consumption and wants to go out in a violent blaze of glory. Or maybe he’s a young upstart who knows just enough about the Harrowed to be dangerous.

Your character wants to die for some reason (secret or otherwise), but only under certain circumstances. Most want to go out in a blaze of glory, such as saving a town or taking some major villain or critter to Hell with them. Your hombre won’t throw his life away for just any little thing (suicide is easy, after all). The Marshal should reward your character for taking extreme chances, but only when they help him attain his most important goal.

## Degeneration 1-5 (Harrowed)

When a manitou enters a corpse and creates a Harrowed, its supernatural energy does more than simply bring that body back to life. Its animating power also makes the body resistant to damage, and it quickly regenerates the flesh when wounds are suffered. Still, undead flesh can’t help but stink a little. For whatever reason, some manitous either don’t care to keep the flesh pickled or just can’t manage it. The Harrowed still heals with supernatural quickness, but his body resumes the process of decay, though perhaps very slowly. The degeneration Hindrance represents that situation. The level of the Hindrance determines what state of decay the Harrowed has reached, as shown in the table below. Players who choose this Hindrance for their Harrowed should keep in mind that living creatures (human or animal) react very poorly to the sight of a decaying corpse up and moving about. They’re especially particular about obvious cadavers. To disguise his condition, the rotten apple needs some heavy clothing and a load of perfume or whiskey to mask his mortuary stench.

Level State of Decay

0 Normal Harrowed: Animals avoid the character, and he bears a slight odor of decay, noticeable on a Fair (5) Cognition roll by anyone right next to him. Any horse ridin’, animal wranglin’, and teamster rolls he makes are at –2.

1 Pallid: At this stage, the Harrowed has an unhealthy grayness to his complexion. His eyes are dull, and the odor of decay is stronger, noticeable on a Foolproof (3) Cognition roll by anyone next to him, or on a Hard (9) roll by anyone in the same room.

2 Slimy: The flesh of the Harrowed has a slick film, and his eyes are milky. His odor is noticeable on an Onerous (7) Cognition roll by anyone nearby. Those who get a long look at him should make a guts check against a Terror score of 5. His various animal-handling aptitudes suffer a penalty of –4.

3 Bloated: Decay has distended the Harrowed’s abdomen with gas and pestilent fluids. The character has watery eyes, and his various orifices leak a bit. The smell of decay is automatically noticeable and animal handling skills are at –6. It can be as embarrassing as you probably think. The undead’s Terror score is 7.

4 Tattered: The Harrowed is losing flesh right off the bone. His skin is tattered, showing the stringy remains of his muscles beneath. In some places, bare bone peeks through. His eyes are sunken. Even if they don’t notice these obvious physical clues, anyone nearby smells the odor of decay on an Onerous (7) Cognition roll. Animals won’t have anything to with him, and his Terror score is 9.

5 Desiccated: All that remains of the Harrowed’s body is parchment skin over stringy ligaments and bleached bones. The character’s eyes look like little dry raisins. They’re so stiff, in fact, that the Harrowed must subtract –4 from any Cognition rolls made to notice things by sight. There is little odor, if any, but the Harrowed creaks slightly when he moves. His animal handling aptitudes go back down to a –4, but the near-mummy takes double damage from fire. His Terror score is 9.

## Disloyal 3 (Indian)

Your character has decided to look for better hunting grounds elsewhere. There are a rare few natives who have renounced their tribal loyalty, turning their backs on their tribes just as the tribes now turn their backs on them. Disloyal natives become notorious among members of their own and surrounding tribes. Other members of their old tribes refuse to help them, and surrounding tribes treat them with disrespect. A Disloyal character suffers a -2 penalty to all social Aptitude rolls with Indians who are aware of his status.

## Doubting Thomas 3

Some folks have a hard time believing in supernatural events even when they they’re halfway down some critters’ gullets. Doubting Thomases are skeptics. It’s hard not to believe in the supernatural after a few adventures, but these characters always look for some more mundane source than the blatantly paranormal.

## Enemy 1–5

The past has a nasty way of coming back to haunt a cowpoke. Remember that every foe you put down likely has some friends or family who might come looking for you later. Your character has an enemy or enemies of some sort. You and the Marshal should determine the value of any enemies based on their relative power level and frequency of appearance. A vengeful but inexperienced youth who is stalking the character, for example, would likely be worth two points, since her appearance would be fairly common but she is relatively weak, not really a threat. If your hero’s being hunted by Jesse James, that might be worth closer to five! A deserter should take an enemy as well, but neither the USA or the CSA have much time or interest, so this is usually only worth 2 points.

## Ferner 3

No man’s an island. Sooner or later, a fellow needs a hand, and if they can’t understand you, they can’t help you. “Ferners” are outsiders in the culture central to your adventure or campaign. Usually,  he outsiders are Mexicans, Indians, or Chinese folks who have a difficult time adapting to the white  man’s language and way of life. An Englishman who insists on bad-mouthing the “democracy” or a Chinese railroad worker who speaks little English are likely to be shunned by most folks on the frontier. Sometimes whites are the ferners. If your Marshal is running a campaign centered in the Sioux Nations those who don’t know the Sioux’s practices and traditions will find themselves the subject of prejudice. As long as your character can communicate well in the culture he’s in and doesn’t go out of his way to prove himself an outsider, he will likely suffer little prejudice and you need not take this Hindrance.  Foreign characters may sometimes suffer from individual intolerance, of course.

## Finicky 3

Some people’ll eat just about anything and your not one of ‘em. Maybe you’re a city boy, or maybe you’ve just got digestive problems. Either way, your stomach can’t handle “wilderness fare” – you need your food to be properly cleaned and cooked before you can stomach it. Eating ill-prepared food causes your hero 1d6 wind damage that lasts 1d4 hours.

## Focus 1-3

When learning how to cast hexes, the huckster learned by focusing on some kind of item. Now she’s got a hard time working without it. For each level of this hindrance chosen, the huckster has a -3 to her attribute roll for attempting to cast a hex without the focus item. The focus item may be anything from a deck of cards to a ceremonial dagger. It may even be the character’s favorite derby. The marshal should have some fun at the hero’s expense with this one, of course 

## Geezer 3/5

You may not have teeth, but you’ve still got a bite. You’re practically a fossil in the Weird West, and  lost cowpokes call you “old timer”. You’ve got one foot in the grave and the other in Hell. Not all older Characters have this Hindrance—some folks are old at 40 and others are still young at 90.  For 3  points, reduce your grandpa’s Vigor and Pace by –2. On the plus side, you get an extra 5 points to buy  Any Knowledge-based skills during character creation. For 5 points, reduce the character’s Vigor by two steps, Pace by –4 and take 10 extra points for Knowledge based skills. Vigor cannot go lower than d4, and Pace cannot go lower than 2.

## Greedy 2

It’s one of the seven deadly sins. But while your mortal soul might be damned to Hell, you’ll sure have a good time here on earth rolling in loot. Money and power mean everything to your scoundrel, and she’ll do most anything to get more of it.

## Grim Servant o’ Death 5

“And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.” — Revelations 6:8 Well, maybe that’s a bit much, but folks do seem to get dead around you. A lot. Maybe you look like a loser, and all the other losers like to pick on you. At least until they find out how quick you are. Or maybe you look like a dandy, but you’re really a huckster with a mean disposition. Whatever the story, your hombre gets picked on a lot, even when he isn’t looking for trouble. You aren’t even necessarily mean-tempered. You’re just trouble looking for a place to happen. Most of those troubles end up buried in Boot Hill while you’re being carted off to the hoosegow. As long as your hombre kills in self defense, juries usually find him innocent. Unfortunately, your character spends a lot of time locked up, on the run, or sitting in a courtroom proving his innocence. Needless to say, local lawmen aren’t fond of your hero. They usually now your character’s name and warn him about staying too long in their towns. Worse than the local  lawmen are hanging judges. They hate the competition and will dream up just about any method imaginable to see you swing.

## Habit 1–3

Folks aren’t much on cleanliness in the Weird West, but that doesn’t mean they like to watch some tinhorn shove his picker up his nose. Your character has a habit others find annoying or revolting. Besides putting off other characters, this Hindrance subtracts a number of points from your character’s persuasion rolls equal to the value of the Hindrance. The value of the Hindrance depends on the frequency of the habit and just how gross and disgusting it is.

## Half-Breed 2 (Indian)

Born Half-Indian and Half-something-else, this character has trouble fitting into either society. He’s still a member of the tribe, but he has few opportunities for advancement. A Half-Breed is treated shabbily by intolerant bigots of both races.

## Hankerin’ 1/3

If you just can’t think without a stogie in your pie-hole, you’ve got yourself a habit. If it’s alcohol or opium you’re craving, welcome to Addiction City, population one. A mild hankerin’ means the character is highly addicted to some mildly harmful substance (such as tobacco), or slightly addicted to a more dangerous substance. A severe hankerin’ means the character is addicted to alcohol, opium, laudanum, peyote, or some other dangerous drug.

Value Status

1 Mild: Subtract –2 from Mental skills if the substance is not available after 24 hours.

3 Severe: Your character suffers the same as above and also subtracts –4 (total) from Mental and Corporeal skills if the substance is not available every 48 hours.

## Haunted 1-5 (Harrowed)

The manitous have a good time when they subject mortals to the terrors of the Hunting Grounds. Sometimes, the manitou inside a Harrowed can use these memories to keep the host off-guard. The souls of haunted undead are dragged kicking and screaming into the Hunting Grounds every time they go dormant (see Sleep on page 22). There they are subjected to horrible nightmares by the cruel parasites inside them. This Hindrance does not function like night terrors—the Harrowed do not suffer fatigue and incur no penalties from restless nights. Instead, the effect is to erode the hero’s will and give the manitou a greater chance the next time it tries to gain control of its host. Every level of this Hindrance subtracts a like amount from the hero’s Spirit roll when checking for Dominion.

## Heavy Sleeper 1

Logs wake up faster than you. Subtract –2 from your hero’s Cognition rolls made to wake up in an emergency or when some critter is sneaking up on him. He usually oversleeps.

## Heroic 3

You’re a sucker for someone in trouble. Ever hear of nice guys finishing last? Heroes who go chasing down wild critters aren’t likely to finish at all. At least they’ll write something nice on your tombstone.

Your character can’t turn down a plea for help. She doesn’t have to be cheery about it, and she doesn’t have to be a “nice” person, but she always helps those in need eventually.

## High-Falutin’ 2

High-falutin’ snobs turn up their noses so high they usually drown when it rains. Your character has no tolerance for those of a lesser class. Those who notice your upturned nose don’t like you. Subtract –2 from any friendly persuasion rolls you make toward those who know your hero thinks they are beneath him in social stature.

## Honorable 3

Whether your character was born into the aristocracy, worked their way into it, or is a sympathetic outsider, they live by the dictates of honor. While this scores points with others who have this Hindrance, it also complicates their lives occasionally. A hero with this Hindrance must be a paragon of virtue, hospitable to guests and charitable to those of lesser social standing (at least in public). Lying, cheating, stealing or even bad manners are unthinkable to an honorable character no matter what advantage might be derived, even when dealing with dishonorable parties. He views any position of authority or leadership as his by right, as well as the respect and obedience of all those of a lesser social standing. Honorable male characters place women on a cherished pedestal, and always rush to their aid. Any slight against his personal character, his family or a lady must be properly avenged. (See “The Code Duello” on page 15 for guidelines) Honorable female characters must yield to the authority of their husbands and fathers, and must be good hostesses, homemakers, and mothers. Only in the total absence of a father or husband (an increasingly common and unfortunate situation due to The War) can honorable women assert their independence. Any dishonorable act which is publicly disclosed results in “social death,” and the character is shunned by most of Southern society, including their family, friends and many who are themselves less than honorable. In this situation, a character is usually better off in the Weird West or some other place where reputations count for little, but most renew their commitment to the strictures of this Hindrance in hopes of regaining social respectability. Be careful about taking this Hindrance. If improperly played, it can cause a fair amount of inter-posse friction. It can also be hazardous to your hero’s health if he takes his honorable self out into the wilder parts of the country. A whole lot of folks out there care precious little for honor

## Illiterate 3

It’s a terrible thing to come back from the dead and not be able to read the words on your own tombstone. Illiterates can’t read even the most basic words of their own language or any other they happen to speak.

## Impulsive 3

Some folks just can’t keep their pistol in their pants (no, not that pistol—that’s the randy Hindrance). We mean this one literally. Impulsive characters are doers, not thinkers. They tend to go off based on their own hunches even while the rest of the posse makes elaborate plans and preparations. Of course, quick action sometimes saves the day, but this Hindrance also gets your character into a lot of trouble, which the rest of the posse may not feel obligated to help her out of. Impulsive characters have a deep and abiding hatred for cautious pansies. The opposite, of course, is also true.

## Intolerance 1–3

There’s some folks you just can’t stand. They don’t cotton to you, and you’d like to push them off a tall cliff. Your character does not get along with certain kinds of people (Mexicans, white men, politicians, and so on) and has nothing to with them if possible. If forced to work with them, he insults and provokes them whenever he gets the chance. The value of the Hindrance depends on the frequency of encounters your character has with those he is intolerant of.

## Kid 2/4

Don’t let that face fool you. A kid with a gun can still blow your guts out. Your character is a kid 8–15 years of age. Most people don’t take him seriously and call him “sawed-off,” “runt”, or “half-pint.” For two points, the kid is 11-15 years old. Reduce his Strength and Knowledge by one step to a minimum of d4. For four points, the kid is 8-10 years old. Reduce his Strength and Knowledge by two steps to a minimum of d4. As you character grows up, you must buy off this Hindrance with Bounty Points (see Chapter Five). When you do, increase his Traits as appropriate. Don’t worry about it too much. Most kids don’t live that long.

## Law o’ the West 3

You’ve heard the expression “nice guys finish last?” There’s some truth to it. A true gentleman of the West won’t draw down on an enemy until the foe draws first. Boot Hill hides the bones of many of these honorable folks. Your hero must live by a code of honor that not everyone else subscribes to. He treats all women with respect even if they’re “soiled doves.” He won’t draw his gun on others who don’t have their own weapons drawn (unless he’s seriously outnumbered and even then he just uses the guns to threaten first). In a duel, he always lets his opponent go for her guns first. And he absolutely refuses to shoot someone in the back, or take a shot at a foe who’s distracted (unless he’s in a large firefight). On the plus side, folks know your hombre is one of the white hats. You can add +2 to any negotiations or friendly persuasion attempts whenever your character’s honorable reputation is known and might make a difference.

## Lame 3/5

There’s an old chestnut that says when something’s chasing you, you’ve only got to outrun one person. Unfortunately, you’re usually that one person. This Hindrance affects a character’s Pace and active defense (using the dodge or fightin’ skill—see Vamoosin’ in Chapter Four).

Value Status

3 Limp: Your hero’s Pace is reduced by –2 to a minimum of 2. Subtract –2 from active dodge rolls and other tests requiring mobility.

5 Crippled: One leg is missing or disabled. Your hero’s Pace is 2 with crutches, 1 without. Subtract-4 from active dodge rolls and other tests requiring mobility.

## Loco 1–5

No one in their right mind would stand up to some of the critters in Deadlands. Maybe that’s why there are so many kooks wandering the High Plains. Loco covers all sorts of crazy. This can range from being absentminded to being a compulsive liar or suffering from phobias, delusions, depression, or schizophrenia. The illness is always present, and it rules your character’s actions most of the time. The value of the Hindrance depends on the severity of the illness and its effects on the character. You should discuss the exact dementia with the Marshal and work out the effects and penalties it has on your nut job. Phobias, by the way, usually inflict a -2 penalty when in the presence of the feared object or situation. This is usually a 2-point Hindrance unless the source of fear is very common, in which case the value is 3 or higher. Major phobias inflict a -4 penalty. The base cost is 3, with higher values for how common the source of fear is.

## Loyal 3

You may not be a hero, but your friends know they can count on you when the chips are down. Your character is extremely loyal to his friends. He willingly risks his life to defend them and protect them for danger.

## Lumberin’ 2

People say you ‘re half-ox, and it ain’t ‘cause you’re strong. You just walk like one – slow and heavy. Stealth isn’t your strong suit. You tend to put your feet down when you walk, good and solid. That’s fine when you want someone to know you’re coming, but not so good when going across snow and especially not on ice. Take a -1 to any nimbleness rolls on snow and ice, and a -2 when trying to avoid cracking through thin ice like on a lake.

## Lyin’ Eyes 3

You can’t hide those lyin’ eyes. Your character can’t tell a lie to save his life. Besides suffering a –4 to his bluff rolls, he cannot mislead, deceive, or even omit the truth from others without giving himself away. Maybe his eyes twitch, or he wrings his hands. Whatever he does, it’s a dead giveaway.

## Macho 3

A key element of Latin culture is the concept of machismo: men will be manly and women exist to serve and pleasure them. Your hero cannot let any slight to his honor or manhood go unchallenged, and women are merely pretty objects there for your entertainment. Your hombre views himself as the epitome of manliness and virility. This can occasionally ruffle some feathers in Mexico, but north of the boarder it may get your hero shot by someone who doesn’t share his views. This hindrance is only available to male heroes.

## Mark o’ Cain 5

Some folks carry with them a mark that’s been in the family since the Garden of Eden. Those who bear the mark o’ Cain are bad seeds, rotten to the core even when they do their best to live above their family heritage. Bearing the mark o’ Cain has several effects. First off, anyone who’s blessed can sense the mark on your hero, even if he’s not a Christian flavor of blessed. Blessed also react at –2 to any social-type roll you make with them. Second, no blessed powers ever work on the character, for any reason. Finally, Grimme’s people (in particular, the Guardian Angels) seek your character out for possible recruitment. This last part wouldn’t be so bad were it not for the induction ceremony, which the Marshal can tell you all about should your hero take the plunge.

## Mark o the Devil 1-5 (Harrowed)

Certain folks can see right through the taut skin of the undead to the rotten, worm-riddled core. That’s when they can get a glimpse of the manitou sitting there and stare straight into the eyes of Hell. On the other hand, some Harrowed seem to wear their damnation like a shiny tin star—at least to people who know what they’re looking for. This Hindrance means anyone with the arcane background Edge—or at least 3 levels in academia: occult—has a chance to see the evil demon wriggling around inside your hero, no matter how good he looks or what kind of disguise he might be using. There’s just no way of properly hiding from prying eyes with the right sort of education. Mad scientists are an exception. They have to have academia: occult at level 3 or more to see the mark o’ the Devil, despite their arcane background. Scientific types just don’t tend to see these things unless they’ve researched them on their own. Whenever a person with one of the above qualifications gets within a few feet of your hero, she can make a scrutinize roll versus the manitou’s Spirit. The viewer can add the level of your Hindrance to her roll. If successful, the viewer sees some sign of the manitou in your hero—perhaps the Harrowed’s eyes glow red or the watcher can see the manitou’s hideous face peeking out at her. Needless to say, such folks won’t trust your character until he’s burning on a stake.

## Miser 3

A miser knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. Miserly characters must always buy the “cheapest” goods available and haggle incessantly over everything. Because of this, she can only buy “el cheapo” gear. See Chapter Three for more on “el cheapo” gear.

## Mean as a Rattler 2

You think the whole world pissed in your canteen. Maybe it did. People tend not to like your hero. He’s hateful and mean-spirited. Besides making it hard for others to like your hombre, subtract –2 from friendly persuasion attempts. At the Marshal’s discretion, you may occasionally be allowed to add +2 to hostile persuasion or overawe rolls.

## “My Kung Fu is Superior!” 1-3

Your hero is easily challenged to a fight, especially if the challenger has the cojones to claim to be a better fighter than you. You’re so proud of your martial arts abilities that you turn three shades of purple when anyone dares to question your vaunted prowess. Worse yet, there’s something about the way you carry yourself that attracts other similar hotheads with boneheaded attitudes similar to your own. And wouldn’t you know it—challengers are extra likely to approach you at a moment of maximum inconvenience? Your hero’s ability to resist the urge to rise to a challenge is determined by how many points of this hindrance you select when you take this Hindrance.

Value Level

1 Onerous (7) Smarts to turn down any challenge to fight.

2 Incredible (11) Smarts to turn down a challenge.

3 Forget it—he’s got to fight each and every time he’s challenged!

## Night Terrors 5

The Indians say nightmares are glimpses into the Hunting Grounds—a mad limbo where evil spirits devour the souls of the newly dead. Your nightmares make you think there might be some truth to this. Your character’s nightmares are far worse than most, something that keeps her from wanting to sleep much. Coffee is her best friend, and she usually only gets about 3–4 hours sleep at night. Make an Onerous (7) Spirit check at the beginning of each game session immediately after drawing Fate Chips. Chips left over from the previous session may be spent on this roll, but those you just drew cannot. Consider them “on loan.” If you fail, your character loses her lowest value chip. This represents the fatigue and strain the constant terror of sleep has on her. Go bust and your character loses her highest value Fate Chip. Roleplay your character’s sluggishness and fear of sleep and your Marshal should reward you with chips as usual, but the real benefit of night terrors lies in the dreams themselves. A character who suffers from night terrors is actually a plaything of evil spirits. They drag her “dream self” into the “Hunting Grounds” and torment her with her own worst fears. Occasionally, however, these dreams reflect reality and can impart important clues into the heroine’s current predicament. The next time your character sleeps after failing her Spirit roll and losing her chip, the Marshal should take you aside and quickly describe your character’s last nightmare. Hidden within the symbolism and pseudoreality of the dream should be an important clue about something in the current adventure or the character’s own background. It’s up to you to interpret the dream, but the Marshal should give your tormented heroine something good for all her suffering.

## Oath 1–5

A person is only as good as his word. Your hero has an oath to perform some important task or always react to certain conditions. The value of the oath depends on how often it might come into play and the risk it involves.

## Obligation 1–5

A man’s got to do what a man’s got to do. Your character is obligated to his family, his job, the military, a town, or a duty of some sort. This should be frequently inconvenient, as he has to report to work or go off on an assignment from time to time. Note that this is not the same as an oat.

## Obvious 1-5

Any character with this Hindrance just can’t be very sneaky when casting her hexes. At these times. she must make extensive hand gestures, produces lots of flashing lights, shooting glowing cards into the air, or maybe even let loose with a feral howl. Whatever effects you choose to validate this Hindrance, it has to be, well, obvious. This may not be the best thing in a place like the weird west, where most people think dealing with evil spirits is wrong. Go figure. Hucksters with this hindrance stay well clear of Texas Rangers and their like. Many try to disguise their magical disability by posing as flamboyant stage magicians.

## Old Ways Vow 3 (Indian)

All loyal members of tribes which follow the Old Ways movement have taken this oath. To honor the sprits, your character has sworn never to use any of the white man’s modern, mass-produced, soulless goods: guns, wagons, steel hatchets, etc. In addition, the character must not travel in any modern conveyances such as train or steam wagons. In return for this respect, the character receives a +2 bonus to all ritual rolls. If the character violates his vow, however, by possessing a gun or riding on a train, he receives a -4 penalty to all ritual rolls. This penalty remains in effect until the situation is corrected. The spirits are not fooled by a shaman who quietly sets his peacemaker to one side while performing a ritual. The chief has the final word as to weather a shaman is in violation of his oath. Note that this is a change from the rules in the Deadlands Rulebook. Only characters who have taken this oath receive theses bonuses and penalties. Indians who do not follow the Old Ways Vow are not affected.

## Outlaw 1–5

The only authority you abide by is the “law of the West.” And even that’s flexible when it suits your needs. Outlaws are lawbreakers by nature. They have little respect for the law and are wanted for everything from petty larceny to horse thieving. The point value depends on just how little respect your character has for others. For 1 point, your “hero” swipes bottles of whisky from behind the counter when the bartender isn’t looking. For 5 points, your blackheart is a cold-blooded killer. The worst of these characters shouldn’t normally be heroes in the world of Deadlands, but sometimes Fate leads folks down strange roads. A jealous, drunken bastard might join a group of “white hats” who are fighting evil. Maybe he sees the monsters as a greater evil than the law. More likely, there’ some treasure or payment for putting an end to some varmint’s rampage. Be careful friend. Most outlaws meet bad ends.

## One-Armed Bandit 3

There are a lot of folks who lost limbs in the war. Fortunately it only takes one finger to yank a trigger.

Your character has only one hand or arm. You must subtract –4 from any skills that require the use of two hands.

## Outcast 2 (LA)

This is for mestizos only. Some mestizos have forsaken their families and tried to join white society, with mixed results. They are not fully accepted by their mestizo brethren, nor are they accepted by many whites. Any outcast character can suffer from intolerance at the hands of mestizo and white characters. Of course, this all depends on the particular situation and how much the people in any given encounter know about the hero and her past.

## Pacifist 3/5

Being a pacifist doesn’t mean a fellow is afraid of a fight. It’s just that he’d rather find a different way. Pacifists range from those who simply don’t like to kill until it’s absolutely (in their judgment) unavoidable (3 points) to those who won’t kill under any circumstances (5 points).

## Poverty 3

A fool and his money are soon parted, and what little cash you’ve got in your pocket is burning a hole straight through your jeans. Your character has a hard time saving, and he spends money like water. He starts with only $50 instead of the normal $250. Try “el cheapo” gear (see page 73) to get your pauper suitably armed.

## Rage 1-5 (Harrowed)

Wine gets better with age. The Harrowed just get meaner. The perpetual struggle with the Manitou within, the temptation of greater power, and the frustration of being undead all push these characters toward bestiality. Get your hands off your horse. That’s not what we’re talking about. Whenever a Harrowed with this Hindrance is wounded by an opponent or gets particularly upset, she must make a Smarts check. The base difficulty of the check is Fair (5), and the undead must subtract her level in rage from her Smarts roll. If failed, the hero goes into a blood frenzy and attacks. She refuses to go into cover or seek to protect herself—she just runs straight at the foe and rampages all over his unfortunate kiester. She can fire a gun along the way, but if the enemy’s still alive when she gets to him, she drops her pistols and gets up close and personal with her bare hands (or claws if she’s got them). Once the foe’s dead (and we mean really, messily dead), the Harrowed can make another Smarts roll. If she makes it, her blood lust is sated and she can act like a normal walking corpse again—whatever that means. If she fails, she starts raging on her former enemy’s companions. She won’t attack her own comrades, but she probably won’t be reading them any bedtime stories either.

## Randy 3

If it moves… School marms run in terror at the sight of your drooling lech. Your character wants sex and lots of it. He or she hits on every reasonably goodlooking member of the opposite gender in sight, usually more than once. Like it or not, men and women suffer this Hindrance differently. If your hero is a man, he’s wellknown in every bordello in the West. Polite society thinks he’s a pig, and “respectable” women avoid him like the plague. The lecherous hero has a –4 to any persuasion rolls made to influence “nice girls.” He suffers no penalties with ladies of lesser morals, but resists their charms at -4. If your character is a woman, all other women, respectable or not, call her all sorts of unpleasant names. She suffers the same penalty as a man around polite society, but other men might treat her differently., especially if the two of them are alone. Your heroine will likely never gain any real respect from “respectable folk” or be able to hold a position of authority if her sordid past becomes known. It may not be fair, but that’s just how it is in the Weird West. On the plus side, a female with this Hindrance actually gains +4 to any persuasion rolls she makes to seduce a fellow. This can have its own consequences, of course, but it can be really handy in getting out of jail, distracting guards, or the like.

## School Rivalry 2

There are countless schools of Chinese martial arts. These schools have long histories, and those histories almost invariably include a deadly, ancient grudge against another school. Entire adventures might center around the feuding between rival schools. It’s up to you to pick the name of your fu fighter’s school; you can choose one described in The Great Maze or you can just make one up. If you use one of the former, your hero already has a built-in rival school. If you make up one of your own, you’ve got to come up the name of a rival school as well. Every member of that rival school is guaranteed to hate your hero’s guts. They can identify her as a member of that school just by watching her moves when she’s fighting. And, wouldn’t you know it, it just so happens that she seems to be constantly running into members of this rival school, no matter how rare it is. She isn’t obligated to fight them, but they might feel obligated to fight her. In fact, you can just about count on it! When combined with “My Kung Fu Is Superior,” this can be a dilly of a Hindrance.

## Scrawny 5

Beanpoles are thicker than you, and in a stiff breeze, you feel like bending. At least your horse is happy about it— he can barely feel you up there on his back. Scrawny cowpokes (who usually run under the name “Slim”) are slight and weak and must subtract –1 from their Size. Their maximum Strength is a d10. A character’s slight frame might benefit him in certain situations, like crawling through a small cave or window, but usually it just gets him picked on.

## Secret Identity 2

Sometimes you have to live a double life. You’ve got an entirely new life or “cover identity” for yourself, and the discovery of your secret can easily lead to your death or disgrace at the hands of your enemies. Characters with this Hindrance often purchase performin’: actin’ to help them play their parts.

## Self-Righteous 3

If you’re not always right, then you’re at least sure the ignorant masses are always wrong. Given a chance, you’re sure you can prove it. Your character believes everything she does serves some greater cause (such as Christianity, the taming of the West, etc.). She never backs down from her beliefs.

## “Sifu! Sifu!” 2-4

Your hero is still in contact with his sifu, the master who trained him. Whenever he sees her, he must bow before her and otherwise act as if he’s a miserable bug and the sun shines out of her patoot. He shows this “respect” even in public or in front of his friends. Although your hero can expect her to constantly castigate him for not living up to some impossible Confucian ideal of behavior, he is not allowed to give her any lip, no matter what she says. There is no amount of humiliation he isn’t willing to endure in order to show his devotion to the sifu. The Marshal should know that it’s okay to threaten your character’s sifu, thus motivating him to go out and save her on a regular basis. On the other hand, he should try not to let your hero’s sifu kick the bucket. Sometimes, though, the Marshal can’t keep an extra alive without blowing his credibility all to bits. If your hero’s sifu does take one too many Winchester rounds to the head, your hero is required to go through a lengthy period of weeping and wailing. If you don’t then buy off the Hindrance (see the Weird West Player’s Guide), the hero’s sifu’s sifu shows up and commences to bossing him around and otherwise making sure that he still gets the full kick out of this Hindrance. Although the sifu has more kung fu in his little pinky that your hero has in his whole body, for some reason she never ends up helping your cowpoke out much. If he asks for her assistance on a mission, she has other things to do. If she’s along with your hero on a fight, she likely gets herself wounded in the first scene, and needs protecting throughout the adventure (This is when your hero cries “Sifu! Sifu!”). If she’s still healthy by the time she meets up with the bad guys, she turns up her nose and refuses to engage such measly opponents. In other words, you can’t use this Hindrance as a back door method of having your fu fighter’s bacon saved whenever he gets into trouble. The sifu isn’t the cavalry. The value of this Hindrance tells how big a role the sifu plays in your hero’s life. If you’re thinking of taking a 4 point sifu, talk it over with your Marshal and fellow players first. If the sifu is forever showing up, that’s going to affect the direction of the entire campaign. The table below gives you a rough idea of how much trouble your fu fighter is going to have with his sifu by the point-value of the Hindrance.

Value Effect

-2 Sifu shows up infrequently. She rarely sends you on missions or requires rescuing.

-3 Sifu shows up once every couple of sessions. She requires a mission or rescue about one out of four sessions.

-4 Sifu shows up every session. Almost every adventure is a mission picked by your sifu, a rescue mission, or the like.

## Slowpoke 1-5

You’d better learn to fight, ’cause you ain’t gonna get away from anything that’s chasing you. Your hombre is faster than a dead turtle. Barely. His Pace is reduced by 1 for each point in this Hindrance, down to a minimum base Pace of 2.

## Smelly 2

Some folks just don’t smell good. It’s not your fault – it’s just the way you are. It’s not a question of bathing, really. Your character just has a smell about him – it may not be noticeable to other people, but animals never miss it. And they don’t like it one bit. Take a -2 to any animal handlin’ rolls and to any sneak rolls if animals are nearby.

## Squeaky 2

Your voice sounds like you swallowed a mouse. Actually, your voice and the mouse’s sound quite similar. Your character suffers –2 to any test of wills rolls he initiates (he can defend normally) that involve his voice.

## Squeamish 3

You can’t hold your chow when you see blood and gore. It’s embarrassing compared to your gunslinger friends who don’t flinch even with half their guts hanging out. Guts checks caused by gory scenes are made at –2.

## Stubborn 2

It’s your way or not at all. If the rest of the world is too stupid to realize you’re right, they can go hang themselves with an itchy rope. The hero is pigheaded and as stubborn as a mule. He always wants to do things his way and holds out until everyone agrees or some major concession to his idea has been made.

## Style Vulnerability 1-3

Although your character may have learned moves from a number of disciplines, his sifu mainly trained him in one particular style of the Chinese fighting arts. This adherence to tradition is a big part of the spiritual essence of kung fu. It also makes martial arts easier to teach to large numbers of students, since it uses set formulas and techniques. The disadvantage of this training method is that you’re a sucker for the classic moves associated with certain other schools. Choose up to three styles described above in the Martial Arts Training edge. When your hero is fighting an opponent with a concentration in one of the styles you have chosen, his Target Number to hit your hero is reduced by 3. You get 1 point for each style you so designate. You can choose a maximum of three styles this way.

## Superstitious 2

Owls never hoot “just for the Hell of it,” and black cats should be shot if they try to cross your path. You keep a rabbit’s foot in your pocket, and you rarely wonder why it didn’t seem to do the rabbit any kind of good. Your character believes in superstitions and tries to live his life by signs and omens. You should check out a book of superstitions from your local library to help you roleplay this Hindrance.

## Tinhorn 2

Dudes using “two-dollar words” are a dime a dozen in the Weird West after gold and ghost rock were discovered in California. Those who live on the frontier don’t take kindly to these fast talking dudes and their New York ways. Tinhorns are big talkers, usually from back East. They use big words and brag about their families a lot.

## The Cup Overflows 2 (Enlightened)

Your hero’s ch’i energy is powerful. A mite too powerful, in fact. Whenever she uses any of the powers described in this book, her internal energy goes all external and wreaks high holy havoc on the surrounding terrain. For example, if she uses monkey goes to the mountain to fly down a sandy hillside, clods of earth explode beneath her as if somebody’s planted the hill with firecrackers. When she leaps into the air to kick a body, winds whip up all around her, whirling sand and leaves all over. Ever time she lands a punch, it sounds like a thunderclap going off. In short, she stands out like a circus clown at a funeral. Anyone who sees her in action knows there’s something not right about her. If they’re regular folks, they run in terror from her, as if she’s some kind of abomination. If somebody watching her knows about martial arts, he knows what she’s all about, and likely target her as the one to shoot first in a fight. And believe me, anybody with experience of the weirdness lurking behind the surface of the Maze is going to know all about martial arts.

## Thin-Skinned 3

You get splinters from your own pistol grip and won’t quit whining about it until you see a sawbones. Increase your character’s wound penalty by 1 whenever your hero is wounded (see Chapter Four).

## Tribeless 3 (Indian)

A native without a tribe is hardly a native at all. Caught between the white and Indian worlds, your character has lost his spiritual grounding. Becoming tribeless can happen any number of ways. The tribe may have been killed in a raid, your hero may have been kidnapped as a child and spoiled by white society, his family may have been cursed, or the character’s parents were from different, warring tribes, and he was conceived in secret. A tribeless character can’t learn tribal rituals, take part in large ceremonies, or request favors know only to cirtain tribes. Tough luck, but at least he has his freedom.

## Tuckered 1–5

A strong man can run a mile without getting winded. Others get tuckered out just getting up in the morning. Reduce your character’s Wind by 1 for each point of tuckered you take, down to a minimum of 4.

## Ugly As Sin 1

It’s too bad the old saying about “stopping a bullet with your face” isn’t true. If it was, you’d sure never have to worry about being shot. Subtract –2 from friendly persuasion rolls made whenever your character’s looks might intervene. On the up side, you can add +2 whenever his looks might help, such as when making overawe or hostile persuasion attempts.

## Unnatural Appetite 1-5 (Harrowed)

Here’s a delightful habit. For some inexplicable reason, a rare few Harrowed develop a craving for one thing or another that, while technically edible, thoroughly disgusts most people. Your character must eat the item of his craving at least once a day. For each day that he goes without that item, he loses 2 Wind. This damage cannot be recovered except by gorging on the item he craves. For each day he spends eating that item again, he avoids suffering any more damage and regains 1d6 points of lost Wind. The level of the Hindrance depends on just how disgusting your appetite is. Once you eat someone’s tongue, your companions are likely to think that snacking on scorpions is a step up. Some examples of disgusting vittles are listed below.

Level Vittles

1 Rotten food, mold

2 Grave dirt, raw meat

3 Bugs, living raw meat, animal blood

4 Human blood

5 Raw human organs, such as the heart, liver, lung, brain, or eyeball

## Vengeful 3

The world needs to be taught a lesson, and you’re the schoolmarm. Your character must always attempt to right a wrong committed against her. Whether this revenge is violent or not depends on her nature.

## Wanted 1-5

Your hombre’s wanted for some crime. He may not be guilty, but he’s on the run and doesn’t want to be caught. Most folks who are wanted are outlaws as well, but they don’t have to be. Some are falsely accused of their crimes. The value of this Hindrance depends on how bad the authorities want your hero and where exactly he’s wanted. Below are a few examples to give you an idea of where your hombre might fit in.

Value Status

1 Thief: Your hero is wanted for a petty crime in a single town or county, or he’s wanted for more serious charges in a foreign country.

2 Swindler: Your hero is wanted for a host of crimes that could net him a few years in prison.

3 Outlaw: Your hero once participated in a bank or train robbery and is wanted in either the North or the South, but not both.

4 Desperado: Folks have read about your sidewinder’s life of crime in both the North and the South. He’s likely killed a few guards in his sordid career. Someday he’ll swing for his crimes.

5 Villain: Congratulations. Everyone hates this bastard. He’s killed innocents and murdered in cold blood. He’s wanted throughout the North and South. He’s wanted dead, not alive.

## Whiteboy 2

You’re Irish, and proud of it – and you don’t deal with those who’ve stood against you. Whiteboys were Irish who refused to do business of any sort with non-Catholics, and particularly with the English. They also hate Blackfeet, and attack them ofter. Your character cannot do business of any sort with a Protestant regardless of nationality or with an Englishman, regardless of religion.

## Wide-Eyed 1

Northerners can usually tell who’s from the South, and one ‘o the ways is by watching their eyes. Southerners ain’t used to so much snow and ice, and have a tendency to stare at it – which is a sure way to go blind. Your characters eyes don’t adjust well to all the glare from snow and ice. Take a -1 to all Cognition rolls when you’re surrounded by snow and ice. Each hour in these conditions the hero must make an Onerous (7) Vigor rolls or become temporarily snow blind for 1d4 hours. Going bust means the condition is permanent.

## Yearnin’ 1–5

Your character has a dream or goal of some sort. Maybe he wants to own his own cattle ranch or become the town marshal of Abilene. The more difficult and dangerous the goal, the more points the Hindrance is worth. It’s up to the player and the Marshal to come to an agreement as to exactly how many points this is worth. If the hero ever attains his goal, he might have to buy off this Hindrance.

## Yeller 5

You usually get shot in the backside and you’ve got the stitches to prove it. Cowards don’t have the heart for combat and try to avoid it whenever possible. “Real” men don’t like them much unless they’re female, in which case they might actually be more appealing. Subtract –2 from guts checks and persuasion rolls made on those with no respect for your character’s cowardly ways.
