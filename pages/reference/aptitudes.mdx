# Aptitudes
Aptitudes are skills, talents, or trades a character has learned during his life. For most people, these skills range from 1 to 5, as shown on the Aptitude Level Table below.

## Academia

_Philosophy, History, Occult, Others_

**Associated Trait:** Knowledge

Bookworms are rarely appreciated in the Weird West until their obscure knowledge about what might kill a critter that’s already gobbled up half the posse comes in handy.

The academia skill provides a hero with information about his chosen subject. A character might also choose a field within a more narrow subject, such as military history. The Marshal should take this into account when asking for academia Aptitude checks and modify the difficulty level accordingly.

Academia concentrations are rarely related.

## Animal Wranglin’

_Bronco Busting, Dog Training_

**Associated Trait:** Mien

Life in the Weird West often depends on the obedience of a good horse.

Similarly, in the North, a pack of sled dogs might help an explorer escape the wrath of some vicious abomination. In  either case, this is the skill a character needs to teach an animal how to obey a human master.

Animal wranglin’ skill checks are opposed rolls versus the animal’s Mien.

Teaching a horse or dog a new trick usually takes 4–5 days.

## Area Knowledge

_Town, County, State, Region_

**Associated Trait:** Knowledge

You’d better know where to run when the bogeyman comes calling.

Area knowledge is a measure of how much a character knows about a place. Every character in Deadlands has detailed knowledge of the town and county they spent most of their life in. Characters who travel a lot, such as scouts and bounty hunters, might have knowledge of other locales as well. A character always knows the basics of an area he’s traveled to or through before, but specific information requires the area knowledge skill.

You can concentrate in any size region, but the bigger the region, the less specific the information.

## Artillery

_Cannons, Gatling Guns, Rockets_

**Associated Trait:** Cognition

When you want to blow sizable holes in critters, you need to haul out the heavy artillery. Cannons and rockets pack the biggest wallop. Gatling guns can hose down hordes of varmints.

Sighting and placing any of these weapons in strategic locations is a matter of Cognition. For Gatling guns, a character uses the shootin’: automatics concentration when firing the weapon.

## Arts

_Painting, Sculpting, Sketching_

**Associated Trait:** Cognition

Sketch artists who work for the army, pulp magazines, or the Tombstone Epitaph get some measure of respect in the Weird West. True “ar-teests” had best not take themselves too seriously, however, since frontier folk are generally too practical to appreciate these more artistic pursuits.

An artist should make an Aptitude check whenever he completes a work of art. This is the quality of the work, and it does not change unless the work itself is later altered in some way. The Marshal should determine the “value” of the piece based on the material it’s made of and the artist’s skill.

The Tombstone Epitaph generally pays $10 for sketches of “unusual” events. Photos are worth more to the papers, but “news” photos aren’t considered art and so are covered under the professional: photographer Aptitude.

## Bluff

**Associated Trait:** Smarts

In poker, a good bluff can win a $1000 pot on a pair of deuces. Telling lies, spinning tall tales, or making someone look behind them so you can get in a cheap shot is all part of the game.

Bluffing is an opposed check versus an opponent’s scrutinize. The more raises you get, the more the opponent falls for it.

## Bow

**Associated Trait:** Deftness

Firing an arrow’s a lot different than blasting away with a pistol. Braves need this skill to use ‘em.

## Climbin’

**Associated Trait:** Nimbleness

Not too many folks in the Weird West go out of their way to climb sheer rock faces. A few scoundrels have had to scamper down rose trellises on occasion, however. Either way, when it comes up, you’re gonna be glad you’ve got it. A fellow can climb at a Pace of 2 plus his climbin’ level, up to a maximum of 5 yards per round.

## Demolition

**Associated Trait:** Knowledge

Sometimes you just have to blow the snot out of some giant creepy crawler.

It’s usually best if you don’t catch your posse in the blast.

A character with this skill knows how much explosive material, whatever the kind, is needed for the job at hand, where to place it, and how far away to stand.

Going bust on a demolition roll usually has disastrous consequences.

## Disguise

**Associated Trait:** Knowledge

Only actors and sneaky secret agents are actually trained in the art of disguise.

Sometimes an outlaw has to learn on the fly, however, and knowing a fake beard from a hairpiece might keep you from looking too silly.

When a character in disguise is spotted by someone who might catch on, the character makes an opposed disguise roll vs. the observer’s scrutinize Aptitude. One success on the part of the observer might make him suspicious, but a success with at least one raise is required to see through the disguise.

## Dodge

**Associated Trait:** Nimbleness

No, we aren’t talking about the town in Kansas (as in “get the Hell out of…”).

We’re talking about the ability to use cover and be where the bullets aren’t.

The dodge skill is used as an “active” defense when your character is about to get drilled.

## Drivin’

_Steam Boat, Ornithopter, Steam Wagon, Others_

**Associated Trait:** Nimbleness

There’s a lot of strange gizmos in the Weird West. Horseless carriages and flying gadgets powered by steam require a new set of skills.

This is the skill a character needs to drive a steam wagon, pilot an ornithopter, or steer a steam-powered boat. Driving a wagon pulled by animals uses the teamster Aptitude.

## Faith

**Associated Trait:** Spirit

Faith is strange. Most folks have more of it when some nasty critter is about to stuff them in its pie-hole. Then they’re full of praise and promises.

In the Weird West, faith can often have a real effect on creatures of the Reckoning.

## Fightin’

_Brawlin’, Knife, Lariat, Sword, Whip, Wrasslin’_

**Associated Trait:** Nimbleness

Sometimes you don’t have enough bullets in your pistol to get the job done.

If you find yourself in one of these situations, it’s time to whip out your trusty Bowie knife and start carving. 

Some skill with the thing might help.

A character uses this Aptitude to make hand-to-hand attacks.

## Filchin’

**Associated Trait:** Deftness

When most people think of Western outlaws, they picture bank-robbing desperadoes. Light-fingered scoundrels are actually more common. This is the skill they use to practice their trade.

Thieves can make an opposed filchin’ roll versus a target’s Cognition to lift objects from pockets, purses, or holsters.

Modify either character’s roll based on the size of the object lifted, the situation, and whether or not the thief has managed to distract his prey first.

## Gamblin’

**Associated Trait:** Smarts

Most folks in the Weird West can hold their own in poker and other games of chance. Professional gamblers roam the boomtowns and can turn a few bucks into a small fortune.

There are two ways to handle gambling in Deadlands. The first is for a single hand; the second is a quick way to sum up an hour’s worth of gambling.

For a single hand, the gamblers first decide on the stakes. Then each character involved makes a Fair (5) gamblin’ skill. Every success and raise lets a gambler draw a card from a card deck. When everyone has their cards, each player flips over her highest. The players with the lowest cards put their stake in the pot, and the winner gets the pot. A Red Joker is the highest card and a Black Joker is the lowest.

To sum up a longer period of gambling, use this method instead. The gamblers first decide on the average stakes. One to five bucks per hand is common for serious gambling. Then everyone makes a gamblin’ Aptitude check. The lowest total pays the highest total the difference times the stakes. The next lowest pays the second highest, and so on. If there’s an odd man left in the middle, he breaks even.

## Guts

**Associated Trait:** Spirit

There’s a lot of strange stuff in the Weird West. When your character stumbles upon a slavering abomination or a gruesome scene, you need to make sure he’s got guts. It’s hard to fill a charging critter full of lead when you’re wetting your pants or losing your lunch.

Failing a guts check can have serious consequences. Don’t worry about it right now. The Marshal’s got all the information she needs to inflict sheer terror on your hapless character.

## Hexslingin’

**Associated Trait:** Special

If you’ve decided to make a huckster, then this Aptitude is your best friend. We can’t tell you much more than that here, hombre.

## Horse Ridin’

**Associated Trait:** Nimbleness

No self-respecting cowpoke admits he can’t ride a horse. It’s an essential skill in the West. A tinhorn who can’t tell one end of a bit of horseflesh from another often finds his companions leaving him in the dust. The quality of the animal may also add or subtract from a character’s skill roll. See page 76 for more information about horses.

## Languages

_Apache, French, Gaelic, German, Latin, Sign Language (Indian), Sioux, Spanish, Others_

**Associated Trait:** Knowledge

Knowledge in foreign languages can often mean the difference between life and death in the Weird West. If you’re exploring an old Spanish gold mine called Casa del Diablo, you’d better know it means “House of the Devil.”

All characters are assumed to be able nto speak and read fluently in their native nlanguage, whatever that may be. nA character with 1 point in another nlanguage can speak and communicate ncommon verbs and nouns with little ndifficulty. At skill level 2 and higher, nthe character can read and write the nlanguage and has a larger vocabulary. nIndian “sign language” is a very useful nconcentration. Nearly all tribes can ncommunicate with this common system.

Explorers and scouts working for the Army should consider this Aptitude a must.

## Leadership

**Associated Trait:** Mien

In the military, careers are often made on whether or not an officer can get his men to do as he tells them. Lawmen also use this skill to stare down mobs and lead their posses into hostile territory.

Besides using leadership to control lackeys, this Aptitude has two important specific uses.

A leadership roll can keep people from being surprised. Whenever a friendly hero fails a surprise roll (explained more in Chapter Four), you can attempt to make the roll for her as long as your character is not surprised as well. This counts as an action for your character. Every success and raise you get on your leadership check allows the leader to affect one other person. If you succeed, they may act normally for that round (meaning they get cards now, too, but must discard any that have already been called).

You can also use your leadership Aptitude to actually trade Action Cards (used to determine when your hero acts) between friendly characters during combat. When it’s your turn to take an action, make a Fair (5) leadership roll. For every success and raise you get, you can help any two players (possibly even including yourself) trade a single Action Card in their hands to each other. The only catch is that in each trade, both players must agree to make the trade first. 

## Lockpickin’

**Associated Trait:** Deftness

Good locks are hard to come by in the West, so if you find one, it’s probably protecting something worth getting at.

A character with this skill and a set of lockpicks can try to open any door, chest, boudoir, chastity belt, or other valuable compartment protected by a lock. A character can attempt a failed lockpickin’ roll multiple times, but each try after the first incurs a cumulative –2 penalty, up to –8. After that, she’s stumped by that particular lock until she earns another lockpickin’ level.

The difficulty of the task depends on the lock itself. This skill works on safes too.

## Mad Science

**Associated Trait:** Knowledge

When it comes to creating a flying machine or a death ray, regular old science Aptitude just won’t cut it.

As you might guess from its name, this Aptitude is essential if you’ve set your sights on your hero being one of the Weird West’s crazed tinkerers.

## Medicine

_General, Surgery, Veterinary_

**Associated Trait:** Knowledge

A good “sawbones” knows when to cut your leg off and when to let it be.

A general concentration in medicine means the doc can use herbs and make poultices, stop bleeding, set broken bones, and perform simple surgery such as lancing boils or digging out a shallow bullet. This concentration lets a character heal up to heavy wounds. He can do nothing for serious and critical wounds and maimed limbs other than stop bleeding.

A doc with the surgery concentration has had formal training in cutting people open. He must have the general concentration first to reflect his training.

Surgeons can stop internal bleeding, perform operations, and dig bullets out of the deepest wounds. It’s a messy job, but somebody’s got to do it.

Vets take care of wounds and ailments in animals. If pressed, a vet can treat a human as if he had the general concentration. Since this is a related skill, he has to subtract –4 from the roll.

Regular doctors can also treat animals, but the wide variety of critters increases the usual penalty for a related skill to –6.

## Overawe

**Associated Trait:** Mien

The most successful gunmen can back down their opponents before anyone slaps leather. An overawe attack might come in the form of a surly stare, a deadly threat, or the feel of cold iron in someone’s back.

An overawe attack is an opposed roll versus a character’s guts.

## Performin’

_Acting, Singing_

**Associated Trait:** Mien

There isn’t a lot of entertainment in the West, so most people appreciate a good actor or a sexy singer. Frontier crowds are rough on the acts they don’t like, but they treat a good performer like gold.

A good performance against a Fair (5) TN can net the character $2d6 plus $1d6 for every raise. Better wages can be earned with some planning, of course, but this rate works for impromptu performances and average-sized crowds.

## Persuasion

**Associated Trait:** Mien

Fast-talking snake-oil salesmen, sultry saloon girls, and nosy muckrakers often depend on their powers of persuasion.

Talking someone into providing aid or information in times of need can be as crucial as skill with a six-shooter.

Persuasion attempts are opposed rolls versus the target’s scrutinize Aptitude.

## Professional

_Journalism, Law, Military, Photography, Politics, Theology, Others_

**Associated Trait:** Knowledge

Gunslingers might rule the streets, but it’s the politicians who hire them, the journalists who make their reputations, and the lawyers who keep them from the gallows.

The professional Aptitude is a catchall category for “social sciences” that require formal education of some sort, such as law, journalism, or theology. A character can use this Aptitude whenever he needs to recount a law or battle, write a news story, or compose a sermon on the evils of strong drink. Actually performing any of these tasks usually falls under another Trait. A minister who needs to deliver a sermon, for instance, would make a professional: theology / Mien roll.

Due to the grab-bag nature of this Aptitude, concentrations in the professional Aptitude are never considered related, and they must be purchased as separate Aptitudes.

## Quick Draw

_Knife, Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun, Sword, Others_

**Associated Trait:** Quickness

When one Peacemaker won’t get the job done, you might have to whip out another. You’d better be able to do it fast.

It usually takes an action to draw a new weapon. If you’ve got this Aptitude, you can draw a new weapon and use it in the same action. The TN is usually Fair (5). If you fail, you draw the weapon normally and can’t use it that action. If you botch, you’ve dropped it. If you botch and you’ve got bad luck, you might blast or cut off your favorite body part.

## Ridicule

**Associated Trait:** Smarts

There’s a fine art to making fun of someone in the Weird West where trigger fingers are itchier than saddle sores. Knowing when and just how far to push your opponent is the real skill.

Using the ridicule Aptitude is an opposed roll versus an opponent’s ridicule. If the target doesn’t have ridicule, she’ll have to default to her Smarts.

Someone with a good sense of humor can take a joke better than someone without. How to use tests of will in combat is covered in Chapter Four.

## Ritual

**Associated Trait:** Special

Indian Shamans who want to talk to the spirits had better have this Aptitude at least if they want the spirits to listen.

## Science

_Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, Physics, Others_

**Associated Trait:** Knowledge

The discovery of ghost rock changed the face of the world forever. Scientists  can now make incredible devices of steam and steel they could barely dream of before. Even those who don’t use the strange new mineral benefit from its research and the inventions it has spawned.

This Aptitude covers book learning, experience, and skill in all sorts of scientific pursuits, except mad science.

That’s its own Aptitude.

If your character is a mad scientist, you must take at least 5 levels in at least any one scientific concentration.

Most science concentrations aren’t related to each other. It’s the Marshal’s call as to whether or not a particular type of science concentration is related to the one required.

## Scrutinize

**Associated Trait:** Cognition

Any gambler worth his salt can tell when an opponent is lying through his teeth. Scrutinizing someone might not tell you everything about her, but it could tell you when the buffalo chips are starting to get thick.

Scrutinize is the ability to judge another’s character, penetrate disguises, or detect lies. A character with this skill is also good at resisting bluff and persuasion attempts from other characters.

## Search

**Associated Trait:** Cognition

Any fool can find an arrow sticking straight out of his backside, but a character with a good eye can find the proverbial needle in a haystack.

This skill covers a hero whenever she’s specifically looking for items, clues, or evidence. Search is also used to detect hidden movement or creeping enemies.

The latter is an opposed roll versus the opponent’s sneak Aptitude.

Search rolls can be used to find obvious footprints, but to actually read a trail and follow it requires the trackin’ Aptitude.

## Scroungin’

**Associated Trait:** Smarts

Scroungin’ is the ability to find common items in a hurry. Sometimes this means settling for less than what is needed, but a good scrounger can usually come up with something that gets the job done.

The Marshal sets the difficulty of finding a particular object depending on the item and the amount of time available.

## Shootin’

_Automatics, Flamethrower, Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun_

**Associated Trait:** Deftness

There’s an old saying about there being only two types of gunslingers: the quick and the dead. In Deadlands, some characters are quick and dead.

Shootin’ is the ability to fire guns quickly and accurately in stressful situations—such as when someone’s shooting back.

The automatics concentration is used with machines like Gatling guns. Weird devices (like flamethrowers) are their own individual concentrations.

## Sleight of Hand

**Associated Trait:** Deftness

Cheating at cards can get you plugged in the Weird West—if you’re dumb enough to get caught. If you’re going to do it, you’d better make sure you’re good at it, or at least a heap faster than the people you’re playing with.

Sleight of hand allows a character to draw small items out of his sleeve or pockets quickly and without notice.

Sleight of hand can be used like the quick draw Aptitude on Derringers, small knives, or any other weapons smaller than a pistol. Treat this as a related skill.

## Sneak

**Associated Trait:** Nimbleness

Sometimes charging into the face of death is a little more foolish than heroic. Occasionally more subtle tactics are called for.

When your character wants to sneak past someone, make an opposed sneak roll against the search Aptitude of anyone who might detect her. The Marshal should dole out modifiers depending on the situation. It’s a lot easier to skulk about by the light of the moon than to avoid a murderous outlaw stalking you at high noon.

## Speed-Load
_Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun_

**Associated Trait:** Deftness

Speed-loading a gun helps serious gunslingers get those empty hoglegs smoking again.

Reloading a single bullet in a pistol, rifle, or shotgun usually takes an entire action. A successful speed-load check allows a character to slam up to 3 rounds into a weapon during a single action. Check the weapon’s maximum number of shots to make sure you don’t load more rounds than it can hold. If a pistol has a speed-loading cylinder (a spare cylinder already loaded with bullets), a Fair (5) speed-load roll slaps  the entire thing in place in a single action. Otherwise, it takes two actions. Gunslingers that actually care for living usually carry a couple spare cylinders ready to load.

If you fail at a regular speed-load roll, your hero still gets one bullet into the gun. If you fail with a speed-load cylinder, though, your cowpoke doesn’t get the cylinder in at all. Try again. 

## Streetwise

**Associated Trait:** Smarts

A streetwise character knows how to work the streets and get information from the seedier elements of towns and cities.

This Aptitude is most often used to get illegal items or restricted information. The difficulty depends on the prize and the steps the character takes to secure it.

## Survival

_Desert, Mountain, Other_

**Associated Trait:** Smarts

A frontiersman can survive with minimal tools and supplies in hostile environments. This might mean eating the stringy meat of prairie dogs while on the high plains, but it beats starving.

A successful survival roll feeds a person for one day. Every raise provides the bare necessities for one other person.

The difficulty of the roll depends on the environment. An area with plentiful game and water has a difficulty of Foolproof (3), while it’s an Incredible (11) task to find vittles in the Mojave desert. You can only normally make one survival roll per day.

## Swimmin’

**Associated Trait:** Nimbleness

Few frontiersman can swim. Those who can’t, usually sink like stones just trying to take their annual baths.

See your local watering hole or Chapter Four to find out about drowning.

A character’s Pace while swimming is his swimmin’ level, up to a maximum Pace of 5.

## Tale-Tellin’

**Associated Trait:** Mien

Tale-tellin’ is the talent of capturing an audience’s attention with a ripping yarn or an exciting story. It’s a rare but valuable ability, the need for which come up a lot more often than you might think. Preachers use the skill to deliver their fiery Sunday sermons, and politicians use it all the time to get themselves reelected.

Spreading the word of your posse’s deeds is very important to becoming a legend of the Weird West. You can find out why telling your tales are vital once you’ve adventured a while and your Marshal feels you’re up to handling the awful truth.

## Teamster

**Associated Trait:** Nimbleness

This skill lets your character drive wagons, stagecoaches, buggies, and carts and control the ornery animals that pull them.

The basic movement rate for a wagon is that of the horse minus its load. See horses in the gear list.

## Throwin’

_Balanced, Unbalanced_

**Associated Trait:** Deftness

If a cowpoke’s relying on throwing things at people, he’s probably already won the fight and just having a little fun.

Balanced weapons are things like knives and hatchets. Unbalanced missiles are rocks, dynamite, and some magical spells.

## Tinkerin’

**Associated Trait:** Smarts

A steam wagon is fine to get you across the Mojave. If it breaks down, though, you’d better make sure you can fix it.

Tinkerin’ is the ability to fix contraptions, gizmos, and gadgets. This Aptitude is a must for mad scientists who want to make or repair the infernal devices they devise. Mad science covers the conception and design of infernal machines, but tinkerin’ is the Aptitude that keeps them running.

Note that plenty of normal folks have the tinkerin’ skill as well. You don’t have to be mad to futz around with Deadlands steampunk, but it helps!

## Trackin’

**Associated Trait:** Cognition

Good trackers usually find whoever or whatever they’re looking for. Of course, that’s not always a good thing in Deadlands.

A successful trackin’ roll helps a character find a trail, stay on it, and maybe even figure out how many critters he’s following. The difficulty for following tracks is shown on the chart below.

## Trade

_Blacksmithing, Carpentry, Seamanship, Mining, Telegraphy, Undertaking, Others_

**Associated Trait:** Knowledge

Life as a gunslinger, a huckster, or a muckraker can be a real kick in the pants, but somebody’s got to actually do all the work. The hard jobs are done by the folks with the practical skills, and that’s what they get paid for. Trade is a catchall skill like the professional Aptitude. It covers hands-on jobs like blacksmithing and undertaking. The usual Aptitude used for trade checks is Knowledge, though this can change depending on the task. A sailor who needs to steer a sailing ship through the Maze, for instance, needs to make a Deftness/trade: seamanship roll to avoid disaster.

Like its counterpart—the professional Aptitude—trade concentrations are never related.
