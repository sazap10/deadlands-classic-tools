# Traits

## Corporeal Traits

### Deftness

The Deftness trait defines your hero’s hand-eye coordination and manual dexterity. No gunslinger should be without it—it’s great for shooting holes in things. Aptitudes associated with the Deftness Trait include such things as throwin’, filchin’ and, of course, shootin’.

### Nimbleness

Without a good Nimbleness Trait, your hero’s going to be tripping over her own boots. It covers agility and overall physical prowess. That means it’s real important to getting out of the way of things trying to do your hero in. Aptitudes associated with Nimbleness are such skills as climbin’, horse ridin’, and dodge. Oh, and fightin’. We’re pretty sure the Marshal’s going to get you real familiar with that last one.

### Quickness

It’s a brutal truth that there are two types of people in the Weird West: the quick and the dead. Of course, in Deadlands, that second option isn’t always as final as it could be. The Quickness trait defines your hero’s reflexes and speed. It’s not used very often for Aptitude checks, except for quick draw. It’s very important because you’ll be rolling it at the beginning of every combat round to determine how many actions your character gets.

### Strength

Strength is a measure of a hero’s raw muscle and brawn. When it’s time to lift something heavy or punch someone out, Strength is your hero’s best friend. It’s not usually tied to particular Aptitudes, though the Marshal might call for certain skills to use the Strength Trait on occasion. For example, if two characters are wrestling for a gun, the Marshal might ask for fightin’: brawlin’ /Strength checks. Strength is also used to determine your damage when your character hits someone in hand-to-hand combat. 

### Vigor

Vigor encompasses a hero’s endurance, constitution, and general fortitude. Vigor is another Trait that has no particular Aptitudes associated with it. The Marshal might use Vigor whenever your character’s endurance could determine the success of a particular Aptitude test, however. For example, a long arduous climb up a steep cliff might call for a Vigor/climbin’ check. Also, a long ride to get help for a wounded comrade might be a horse ridin’/Vigor roll.

## Mental Traits

### Cognition

If you’re going to keep your hero’s carcass out of the boneyard, they’d best be alert. A good Cognition is advisable. It covers perception and general alertness. Aptitudes covered by Cognition are things like search, scrutinize, and the hunter’s best friend, trackin’

### Knowledge

Few cowpokes wandering the High Plains are especially educated. Those who are have a high Knowledge. If your hero has garnered a lot of book-learning and experience, she’ll have a high Knowledge. Academia, professional, and trade Aptitudes are all Knowledge—based, as well as languages and the often important medicine skill.

### Mien

A hero’s Mien describes his presence and influence, as well as charisma and how the character is regarded by others. A high Mien is important when a hero needs to impress a crowd, intimidate an enemy, or train a wild bronco. Mien encompasses Aptitudes like leadership, overawe, and tale tellin’.

### Smarts

Gamblers and the like need to know how to think on their feet. A high Smarts is essential as it covers wits and deduction. This is also the ability used to figure things out or piece together clues. Survival and streetwise are a few of the more important Aptitudes covered by Smarts, as well as the mad scientist’s best friend, tinkerin’.

### Spirit

The otherworldly pervades the lands and people of the Weird West, and a hero’s Spirit tells you how strong their connection to it is. It’s a hero’s psyche and spiritual presence. Only a very few Aptitudes are linked to the Spirit Trait, but they’re important ones, like faith and guts. 

## Secondary Traits

### Grit

As your hero experiences the terrors of the Weird West, he’s going to eventually get jaded to some of them. Characters with Grit can weather horrific sights and experiences better than those without it.

### Pace

Your hero’s Pace determines how far they can move in a combat round. You’ll learn all about that in Chapter Four. For now, just write down your hero’s Nimbleness die type here. A character with a Nimbleness of d10 would have a Pace of 10. This number might be modified by Edges or Hindrances you buy. If so, don’t forget to change it.

### Size

Your hero’s Size is a measure of just how big she is. Unless she has a special Edge or Hindrance that modifies it, her Size is 6. When your character takes damage, each increment of her Size causes a wound.

### Wind

Wind represents the amount of shock, fatigue, or trauma your character can take before he’s too beat to do anything else. It’s derived from your character’s Vigor + Spirit die types. If your hombre has a d8 Vigor and a d10 Spirit, her Wind is 8+10=18
